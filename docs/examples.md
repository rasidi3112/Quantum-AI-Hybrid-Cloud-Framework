## Overview

The examples/ directory provides ready-to-run educational resources to help researchers, students, and engineers quickly understand and experiment with hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. It includes:

- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for quantum state visualization  
- Standard benchmark datasets (e.g., Iris) for reproducible experiments  
- Minimal, self-contained code that mirrors the framework’s core capabilities

---

 All examples are designed to:  
- Run out-of-the-box with pip install -r requirements.txt  
- Work across macOS (M1/M2), Linux, and Windows  
- Serve as templates for custom quantum ML pipelines

## 1. quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb — Quantum State Visualization  
      Purpose  
      Demonstrates how quantum states generated by parameterized circuits can be mapped to the Bloch sphere—a geometric representation of a single qubit’s state.
