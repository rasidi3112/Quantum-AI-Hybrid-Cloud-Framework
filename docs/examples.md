## Overview

The examples/ directory provides ready-to-run educational resources to help researchers, students, and engineers quickly understand and experiment with hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. It includes:

- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for quantum state visualization  
- Standard benchmark datasets (e.g., Iris) for reproducible experiments  
- Minimal, self-contained code that mirrors the framework’s core capabilities

---

 All examples are designed to:  
- Run out-of-the-box with pip install -r requirements.txt  
- Work across macOS (M1/M2), Linux, and Windows  
- Serve as templates for custom quantum ML pipelines  


## Directory Structure  

```bash

├── notebooks/
│   └── quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb    # Visualize single-qubit states on the Bloch sphere
└── iris.csv                        # Standard 3-class classification dataset (150 samples)
```

 1. quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb — Quantum State Visualization  
      Purpose:  
      Demonstrates how quantum states generated by parameterized circuits can be mapped to the Bloch sphere—a geometric representation of a single qubit’s state.
    
    Key Concepts Covered  
  - Qubit parameterization using rotation gates (RY, RZ)  
  - Statevector extraction via PennyLane’s qml.state()  
  - Bloch vector computation from complex amplitudes  
  - 3D interactive visualization using Plotly

    How to run :
```bash
    jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb
```
 *Tip: Modify theta and phi to explore how gate angles affect qubit orientation. This notebook is ideal for teaching quantum state geometry or debugging quantum layers*  

 2. iris.csv — Benchmark Classification Dataset

Why Iris?

- Standard baseline in classical and quantum ML literature  
- Small size → ideal for simulator-based QML experiments  
- Balanced classes → fair evaluation of hybrid classifiers

Usage in Training  
```bash
python -m qml_app.main train \
    --model hybrid \
    --dataset examples/iris.csv \
    --backend default.qubit \
    --device mps \
    --epochs 50
```
