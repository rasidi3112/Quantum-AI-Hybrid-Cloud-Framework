## Overview

The examples/ directory provides ready-to-run educational resources to help researchers, students, and engineers quickly understand and experiment with hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. It includes:

- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for quantum state visualization  
- Standard benchmark datasets (e.g., Iris) for reproducible experiments  
- Minimal, self-contained code that mirrors the framework’s core capabilities

---

 All examples are designed to:  
- Run out-of-the-box with pip install -r requirements.txt  
- Work across macOS (M1/M2), Linux, and Windows  
- Serve as templates for custom quantum ML pipelines  


## Directory Structure  

```bash
examples/
├── notebooks/
│   └── quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb    # Visualize single-qubit states on the Bloch sphere
└── iris.csv                        # Standard 3-class classification dataset (150 samples)
```

 1. quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb — Quantum State Visualization  
      Purpose:  
      Demonstrates how quantum states generated by parameterized circuits can be mapped to the Bloch sphere—a geometric representation of a single qubit’s state.
    
    Key Concepts Covered  
  - Qubit parameterization using rotation gates (RY, RZ)  
  - Statevector extraction via PennyLane’s qml.state()  
  - Bloch vector computation from complex amplitudes  
  - 3D interactive visualization using Plotly

    How to run :
```bash
    jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb
```
 *Tip: Modify theta and phi to explore how gate angles affect qubit orientation. This notebook is ideal for teaching quantum state geometry or debugging quantum layers*  

 2. iris.csv — Benchmark Classification Dataset
    
     Dataset Summary

| Feature  | Value                             |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Samples  | 150                              |
| Features | 4 (sepal/petal dimensions)       |
| Classes  | 3 (setosa, versicolor, virginica)|
| Format   | CSV (comma-separated)            |
| License  | Public Domain                    |

Why Iris?

- Standard baseline in classical and quantum ML literature  
- Small size → ideal for simulator-based QML experiments  
- Balanced classes → fair evaluation of hybrid classifiers  

---

Usage in Training  
```bash
python -m qml_app.main train \
    --model hybrid \
    --dataset examples/iris.csv \
    --backend default.qubit \
    --device mps \
    --epochs 50
```
*The framework automatically infers input_dim=4 and n_classes=3 from this file.*

Integration with the Full Framework  

| Example                        | Connects To                                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| quantum_bloch_demo.ipynb        | models/quantum_layers.py (same circuit design) |
| iris.csv                        | training/, deployment/, evaluation/ pipelines  |  

You can:

- Train a hybrid model on iris.csv  
- Export it to TorchScript (qml_app.export)  
- Serve it via FastAPI (deployment/api.py)  
- Visualize inference in the Streamlit dashboard (deployment/dashboard.py)

---

## Educational Use Cases

This module is ideal for:

- University courses in quantum computing or AI
- Workshops on hybrid quantum-classical modeling
- Onboarding new team members to the framework
- Prototyping new quantum ansätze or feature maps
